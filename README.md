# Mood Microwave simulator üéØ

### Project Description
We use OpenCV to detect your mood and then recommend some delicious food for you. The twist is that you have to scream loudly to heat your food in the oven! The louder you scream, the more your food gets cooked‚Äîbut beware, if you scream too much, your food might end up burnt, and we‚Äôll show your decibel level to track it!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever found yourself craving food but feeling too moody to decide what to eat? Or maybe you wish cooking involved less boring pots and pans and more... screaming? 
Well, here‚Äôs the conundrum: How do we use cutting-edge computer vision and your vocal cords to whip up some grub in the most chaotic kitchen experiment ever?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
 We‚Äôll use OpenCV to read your mood ‚Äî happy, sad, hangry, you name it. Based on that mood, we recommend some drool-worthy dishes. But here‚Äôs the kicker: Instead of a microwave or stove, you heat your meal by unleashing your inner banshee. The louder you scream, the more your food cooks (or burns). Decibel meter at the ready, because if you go full rock concert mode, prepare for a charred masterpiece. It‚Äôs food tech meets rock star rage‚Äîentertainment and dinner all in one!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML5, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (Vanilla JS),Web Audio API (JavaScript) for microphone input to measure sound (decibel level)
- Tailwind CSS, Web audio API

### Implementation
For Software: No installation required for this client-side app beyond hosting an HTML file with internet access to load Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts CDN.

### Project Documentation
For Software: 
User selects mood: Happy, Excited, Sad, Angry. The background color and theme change accordingly.
Food options relevant to the selected mood are shown with icons and descriptions.
Upon selecting a food, microphone access is requested.
The louder the user screams, the more the virtual food "cooks."
A decibel meter visually displays the sound intensity.
After stopping screaming, the app calculates the average decibel and displays whether the food is "Undercooked" or "Overcooked."
Users can try again anytime to select different moods or food.

Introduction & Setup

The demo starts by opening the simulator in a modern web browser.
The interface greets the user and asks, ‚ÄúHow are you feeling darling?‚Äù with options such as Happy, Excited, Sad, and Angry.
The background and color theme change dynamically according to the selected mood, visually reinforcing the choice.

Mood Selection
The user clicks one of the mood buttons (e.g., üòä Happy).
The application responds by showing a personalized message and a selection of foods tailored for that mood.
Each food is displayed as a button with an appealing icon and a brief description, reinforcing the customized experience.

Food Recommendation & Selection
The user browses through food recommendations relevant to their mood (for example, ‚ÄúPuttu and Kadala Curry‚Äù for Happy).
The user selects a food item they wish to "cook."

Interactive Cooking with Microphone
Upon food selection, the app transitions to the microwave simulation screen.
Users are prompted to "heat" their chosen food by screaming into their device‚Äôs microphone.
The app visualizes the live sound input as a decibel meter, showing how loud the user is screaming.

Cooking Result & Feedback
The user clicks "Stop" to finish the heating phase.
The app calculates the average decibel level and determines if the food is "Undercooked" (if volume is too low) or "Overcooked" (if volume is high), displaying a playful message and the user‚Äôs average decibel score.
The feedback is shown along with the chosen food‚Äôs name and icon, enhancing user engagement.

Option to Replay
The user is offered the option to "Try Again"‚Äîthey can change mood or food to explore different outcomes with different moods, foods, and ‚Äúcooking‚Äù intensities.
